# Student Grade Table version 5.0 03/27/2017

The Student Grade Table is an individual project that I did in order to practice using Twitter Bootstrap, AJAX, updating the DOM, and creating multiple functions.  Ultimately, I used it to practice creating, reading, updating, and deleting a.k.a. CRUD.  I eventually, deleted the AJAX api calls I created with jQuery and used a Firebase database instead.
